# **S**imple **C**omputer 0

## What is this?

The Simple Computer 0 (**SC0**) is a hobby project of mine that seeks to emulate a basic computing system from scratch. Inspired by [Dr. Yale Patt's LC3](https://users.ece.utexas.edu/~patt/), the SC0 is a piece of software written in Rust that implements its own instruction set and basic assembly-esque language. The SC0 parses input programs, converts them into "readable" code, and executes it.

I hope, in creating this project, that I can learn more about computer architecture as well as express the building blocks of computers in an elegant, easy to read manner.
